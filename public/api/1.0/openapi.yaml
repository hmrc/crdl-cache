  title: CRDL Reference Data API
  description: |
    This service provides an API and caching layer for transit and excise reference data.
    
    The data originates from the EU CS/RD2 and SEED reference data systems and is hosted at DPS (Data Platform Services).
    
    This service exists to reduce the load on the DPS reference data APIs by caching reference data within MDTP.

      These endpoints provide operations for working with reference data codelists.
      
      Reference data codelists usually have a key-value structure, but in some cases they may have additional useful properties.
      
      For example, entries in the excise products codelist (BC36) contain properties describing the excise product category
      they belong to, and applicability flags describing which kinds of excise information apply to that particular product.

      These endpoints provide operations for working with customs office lists.
      
      Customs office lists provide information about offices like their address, contact details, schedule, etc. Each customs office has a unique reference number.
    
      Most of the fields are optional for the response, only a few are mandatory like referenceNumber, activeFrom, countryCode, postalCode, traderDedicated, customsOfficeDetails and CustomsOfficeTimetable details.

        We can implement our own error handler if this proves excessively unhelpful to consuming services.
